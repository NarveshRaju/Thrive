### How this makes your project "Animated & Interactive"
* **Visual Anchors**: By including a placeholder for a UI screenshot at the top, you immediately hook the viewer's eye.
* **Bento Table**: Using Markdown tables to categorize your AI modules makes the project feel like a SaaS landing page[cite: 134, 137].
* **Code Blocks with Emojis**: This makes technical setup look approachable and modern rather than like a wall of text.
* **Directory Visualization**: The `text` tree structure allows judges or contributors to "walk through" your logic without opening a single folder[cite: 130].

**Would you like me to generate a custom SVG "Progress Bar" or "Brand Card" that you
